# NeoVim config for web developers

This is a very simple NeoVim configuration primarily aimed towards web
development using languages such as JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, and CSS.

This configuration is based on the starter template for [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).
Refer to the [documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) to get started.

## Getting started

If you want to try this configuration, make sure to create a backup copy of your
current setup first:

```bash
# required
mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim.bak

# optional but recommended
mv ~/.local/share/nvim ~/.local/share/nvim.bak
mv ~/.local/state/nvim ~/.local/state/nvim.bak
mv ~/.cache/nvim ~/.cache/nvim.bak
```

Then, clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nizamiza/nvim.git ~/.config/nvim
```

Have fun!
